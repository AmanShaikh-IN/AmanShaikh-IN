# Hi there

I'm an undergraduate student in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** with a strong focus on  
**Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Deep Learning systems**.

## Primary Focus Areas

**AI/ML Systems:**
- Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on AWS infrastructure
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA) with CUDA optimization
- Multimodal deep learning (audio–visual systems)

**AI/ML Infrastructure & Operations:**
- Deploying LLMs and RAG systems on containerized infrastructure (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Managing ML workloads on HPC clusters with SLURM orchestration
- Observability and monitoring for AI pipelines (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Infrastructure automation for ML systems (Python, Bash, Terraform)

## Systems & Embedded Background
I also have substantial experience in **embedded systems, robotics, and low-level programming**, including real-time perception, control logic, and sensor fusion in competition-grade robots.  
This background strongly influences how I design AI systems — particularly around **memory efficiency, scalability, and deployment feasibility** — and complements my current focus on large-scale AI and LLM-based systems.
